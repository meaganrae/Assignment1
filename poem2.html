    <p>found on page 30 in Devotion by Patti Smith</p>
    <p>Deep inside the earth your little bones your little hands your little feet in restless repose unfastening loops calling for bread and potato soup a shock of light struck the valve milk of the lamp poured from the side and a terrible mist rose underfoot you were all snow white and i the seventh dwarf prepared to serve you there were wafers enough for every living thing who offered his tongue there were no fastening heart</p>
    <p>Only the relics of consumption</p>
    <p>warpped in the silk of existence</p>
