    <ol>
      <li>Deep in the earth your little bones</li>
      <li>your little hands your little feet</li>
      <li>in restless repose unfastening loops</li>
      <li>calling for bread and potato soup</li>
      <li><em>a shock of light struck the valve</em></li>
    </ol>
    <ol>
      <li>milk of the lamb poured from the side</li>
      <li>and a terrible mist rose underfoot</li>
      <li>you were all snow white</li>
      <li>and I the seventh dwarf</li>
      <li><em>prepared to serve you</em></li>
    </ol>
    <ol>
      <li>there were wafers enough</li>
      <li>for every living thing</li>
      <li>who offered his tongue</li>
      <li>there were no more cries</li>
      <li><em>there was no fastening heart</em></li>
